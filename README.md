# Kindle Auto Brightness Bridge for KOReader

A lightweight KOReader plugin for Kindles with ambient light sensors (Oasis, Voyage, Paperwhite SE, Scribe) that keeps KOReader's brightness controls in sync with the Kindle's native auto-brightness.

## The Problem

When you run KOReader on a Kindle, the Kindle OS still adjusts the screen's frontlight in the background based on ambient light. However, KOReader caches its own brightness level in memory and doesn't know when the hardware changes underneath it.

This leads to annoying jumps: the Kindle might dim the screen in a dark room, but the next time you swipe to adjust brightness in KOReader, KOReader starts from its old cached value and suddenly snaps the light back to that level.

## What this plugin does

Instead of relying on KOReader's cached brightness, this plugin wraps KOReader's brightness read method (`frontlightIntensity()`) to query the live hardware intensity directly from Kindle's native power daemon (`powerd:frontlightIntensityHW()`) whenever KOReader needs it.

- **Zero background polling**: It only queries the hardware when KOReader actually asks for the current brightness (e.g. when you swipe, open the frontlight menu, or receive an OSD update). No background timers or battery drain.
- **Lets Kindle OS do the heavy lifting**: The Kindle's native firmware handles the light sensor and ambient curves; this plugin just makes sure KOReader stays in sync.
- **Clean and reversible**: No KOReader core patches needed. You can toggle it on or off on the fly from KOReader's menu.

## Requirements

- A Kindle with a frontlight and ambient light sensor (e.g., Kindle Oasis 2/3, Kindle Voyage, Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Kindle Scribe).
- Stock Kindle **Auto Brightness** enabled in the native Kindle settings before opening KOReader.
- A modern KOReader version.

*(If your Kindle doesn't have an ambient light sensor or frontlight, the plugin automatically disables itself and hides from the menu).*

## Installation

1. Copy the `kindleautobrightness.koplugin` folder into your Kindle's KOReader plugins directory:
   ```text
   koreader/plugins/kindleautobrightness.koplugin/
   ```
2. Restart KOReader.
3. Make sure **Auto Brightness** is turned on in the native Kindle swipe-down menu.
4. In KOReader, open the top menu and go to **More tools** (wrench icon) → check **Synchronize with Kindle Auto Brightness**.

The plugin is disabled by default. Once checked, KOReader's brightness gestures and dialogs work as normal, but always start from the actual current light level.

## How it works

KOReader's generic power management (`PowerD`) keeps an internal `fl_intensity` cache and returns it whenever a widget or gesture calls `frontlightIntensity()`.

When enabled, this plugin hooks `frontlightIntensity()` on the active Kindle `PowerD` instance:
1. It queries the live hardware level via KOReader's Kindle LIPC interface (`frontlightIntensityHW()`).
2. If the light is on, it updates KOReader's cached `fl_intensity` and frontlight state to match the hardware.
3. If the light is off (`0` / minimum), it reports `0` while preserving the last remembered non-zero level so KOReader can restore it properly when turned back on.

If you adjust brightness manually inside KOReader, your manual change takes effect as usual, and the Kindle's auto-brightness algorithm adapts from the new baseline.

## Troubleshooting

- **Menu item doesn't appear under "More tools"**:
  Make sure the directory is placed at `koreader/plugins/kindleautobrightness.koplugin` and contains both `_meta.lua` and `main.lua`. If the files are in place, the plugin detected that the device is either not a Kindle or lacks an ambient light sensor / live frontlight read capability.
- **Brightness doesn't adjust automatically**:
  Check that native Auto Brightness was turned on in the stock Kindle OS before launching KOReader. If you enabled it while KOReader was already running, restart KOReader.
- **Debugging**:
  Enable debug logging in KOReader (**Settings** → **Device** → **Developer options** → **Enable debug log**) and look for messages starting with `KindleAutoBrightness:`.
